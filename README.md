# 🧙‍♂️ DUNGEON OF DREAD 🔥

> A Python terminal-based adventure game where you face the ultimate enemy of every coder: **Bugzilla** – a monstrous creature born from cursed legacy code. Can you survive with only your wit, your keyboard, and a few potions of Debug?

---

## ⚔️ GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW

You, brave dev, enter the **Dungeon of Dread** – a haunted place filled with broken code, mysterious sounds, and one terrifying bug.

Make decisions in real-time:

- `fight` – swing your mighty keyboard and attack Bugzilla!
- `potion` – drink a Debug Potion to heal your soul (and your HP)
- `taunt` – roast Bugzilla with savage one-liners
- `run` – if you're feelin’ like a certified coward

💀 Each action affects your health or Bugzilla’s. Defeat the beast or run before your terminal turns into a grave.
